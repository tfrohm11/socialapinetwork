# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

## User Story
### As a social media startup i want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Application Run Down
### Given social network API, when the user enters the command to invoke the application then the server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database. When the user opens API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON when the user tests API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia then they are able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database. When a user tests API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia then they are able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
